<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>In this article, two algorithms are proposed to solve multiobjective path-constrained dynamic optimization problems. In each algorithm, an adaptive ε -constraint method is employed to solve the multiobjective dynamic optimization problems (MODOPs) with path constraints in two iterative loops. In the outer loop, the adaptive ε -constraint method adaptively adjusts the choice of the parameters ε , which transfers MODOP into a sequence of single-objective dynamic optimization problems (SODOPs) with extra inequality constraints. In the inner loop, two different algorithms are used to solve the single-objective optimization problems. The first algorithm guarantees that the path constraints can be satisfied with any finite prescribed tolerance by replacing path constraints with a finite number of point constraints. Furthermore, the second algorithm guarantees that the path constraints are rigorously satisfied by enforcing the path constraints at a limited number of time points and by restricting the right-hand side of the path constraints. The proposed algorithms are proven to converge within finite iterations. The effectiveness of the algorithms is verified via numerical studies, along with a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm. </p>

<strong>An alternated direction method for consrained multiobjective optimization problems</strong><br>
Jun Fu; Chenxuanyin Zou<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>We propose a novel SQP-type method for constrained multiobjective optimization problems in this paper. The proposed algorithm utilizes quadratically constrained quadratic subproblem, where one alternated objective predominates while the others do not increase, for parallel Pareto improvement. This method divides one generation of solutions into non-dominated and dominated parts, where the former mainly searches the descent direction based on the subproblems, and the latter either descends based on the subproblems or follows the closest non-dominated point according to the score function. The convergence, of the proposed algorithm, to premium Pareto solutions, is discussed under the differential assumptions. Furthermore, some numerical cases are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm, along with a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm.</p><br>
