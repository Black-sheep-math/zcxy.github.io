<strong><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9888236">Multiobjective Dynamic Optimization of Nonlinear Systems With Path Constraints</a></strong>, <br>IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 2022<br>Jun Fu; Chenxuanyin Zou; Mingsheng Zhang; Xinglong Lu; Yuzhe Li<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>In this article, two algorithms are proposed to solve multiobjective path-constrained dynamic optimization problems. In each algorithm, an adaptive ε -constraint method is employed to solve the multiobjective dynamic optimization problems (MODOPs) with path constraints in two iterative loops. In the outer loop, the adaptive ε -constraint method adaptively adjusts the choice of the parameters ε , which transfers MODOP into a sequence of single-objective dynamic optimization problems (SODOPs) with extra inequality constraints. In the inner loop, two different algorithms are used to solve the single-objective optimization problems. The first algorithm guarantees that the path constraints can be satisfied with any finite prescribed tolerance by replacing path constraints with a finite number of point constraints. Furthermore, the second algorithm guarantees that the path constraints are rigorously satisfied by enforcing the path constraints at a limited number of time points and by restricting the right-hand side of the path constraints. The proposed algorithms are proven to converge within finite iterations. The effectiveness of the algorithms is verified via numerical studies, along with a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm. </p>

<strong>An alternated direction sequantial quadratic programming method for consrained multiobjective optimization problems</strong><br>Jun Fu;<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Regulation needs effective supervision; but regulated entities may deviate with unobserved actions. For identification, we analyze banks, exploiting ECB’s asset quality review (AQR) and supervisory security and credit registers. After AQR announcement, reviewed banks reduce riskier securities and credit (also overall securities and credit supply), with largest impact on riskiest securities (not on riskiest credit), and immediate negative spillovers on asset prices and firm-level credit supply. Exposed (unregulated) nonbanks buy the shed risk. AQR drives the results, not the end-of-year. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit, with medium-term negative firm-level real effects via credit. Results suggest banks mask risk in supervisory audits, especially using liquid securities that are easier to trade, with not only short-term spillovers on asset prices and credit supply, but also with medium-term implications for the real economy, holding important implications for policy.</p><br>
