Welcome! My name is Zou Chenxuanyin, and I am a graduate student at Northeastern University in Liaoning province and will obtain my Master's degree in 2023.

<br><br>
My research focuses on multiobjective optimization, semi-infinite programming, and optimal control. I am currently trying to incorporate parallel and distributed computation into my research to intensify the power of algorithms to solve large-scale and complicated problems and improve efficiency. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://zcxy-academic.github.io/research" target="_self">research page</a> to learn more!
